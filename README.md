<h1 align="center">Snake game</h1>
<br/>
<p>Hi, this is project for the end of my first course in university. Basically it's snake game with some extra features. It's includes changing type of surface to TOR which means that than snake won't crash against the wall and just go through and will appear from other side. Snake accelerate by getting points and the cherry on the pie is AI. Snake includes simple AI and posibility to teach it on your own.</p>
<p>Realisation made with python 3 (I used version 3.7.4) with kivy framewok. Idea of AI was taken from foo52ru <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXcIf5YwaUQ&t=354s</a></p>
<p>Hope you'll enjoy it! Have fun c:</p>
